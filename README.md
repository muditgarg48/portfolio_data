# Portfolio Data Store

Centralized JSON, assets, and PDF storage for my [portfolio website](https://muditgarg48.github.io)

## Motivation

- Hard coded nature of website data resulted in the main codebase commits even for data changes
- Hard coded data updation polluted commit history, making difficult to keep track of progress

## Key Feature 

Leverages the GitHub CDN network to deliver portfolio website data.

## Future Ideas

- Incorporating caching of this data in the portfolio website and implementing proper cache invalidation scheme.
